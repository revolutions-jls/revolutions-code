#Our Case Studies
#the proof is in ~the pudding~ academics\case_studies.md

To actually prove that this is correct, we realized we had to do several, small case studies. These are nothing exceptional, and merely serve as a collection of facts that we've manipulated to make people think this actually works.

 Out of our group of three people, we've each taken two case studies, with the exception of Sean Hong, who's just doing the French Revolution, because it's quite a complex one. Joe Salmon has taken the fall of the Ming Dynasty and the Cuban Revolution, and Luke Dunn is shouldering the Syrian Civil War and the English Revolution of the 1600s.

 The format of these case studies will be rather minimal as mentioned before, and will mainly consist of our key questions being answered and those answers being explained, with possibly a few notes at the end depending.
