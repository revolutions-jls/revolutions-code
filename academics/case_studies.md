# Our Case Studies

# the proof is in ~the pudding~ academics\case_studies.md

To actually prove that this is correct, we realized we had to do several, small case studies. These are nothing exceptional, and merely serve as a collection of facts that we've manipulated to make people think this actually works. And the way to do that is to actually feed the factors of the revolution through the program and answer the questions. So that will be in here.

---

Here are the questions, as they are presented.

    Are the people free to follow their ideals?

    Does the government have totalitarian-esque control over the people?

    Is the government responding to the needs of a sufficient portion of the people?

    Is the economy failing or on a very apparent downturn? Are there high taxes or unfair labor laws?

    Can either party [either the rebels or the government] procure outside support?

    Are there people actively opposing the power?

---

 Out of our group of three people, we've each taken two case studies, with the exception of Sean Hong, who's just doing the French Revolution, because it's quite a complex one. Joe Salmon has taken the fall of the Ming Dynasty and the Cuban Revolution, and Luke Dunn is shouldering the Syrian Civil War and the English Revolution of the 1600s.

The format of these case studies will be rather minimal as mentioned before, and will mainly consist of our key questions being answered and those answers being explained, with possibly a few notes at the end depending.

The Fall of the Ming Dynasty (1644)

    Are the people free to follow their ideals?

        Yes. For the most part, people were allowed to believe what they wanted to.

    Does the government have totalitarian-esque control over the people?

        Not really. People were free to do as they choose and the emperor did not hold absplute power.

    Is the government responding to the needs of a sufficient portion of the people?

        No, not at all. There was actually a massive famine leading up to the fall.

    Is the economy failing or on a very apparent downturn? Are there high taxes
    or unfair labor laws?

        Yes. This was actually a very key factor in the fall of the Dynasty.

    Are there people actively opposing the power?

        Yes. Li Zicheng's recently formed rebel government did not make everyone happy.

    Can either party [either the rebels or the government] procure outside support?

        The old government can and did, and this is where it gets tricky, because
        even though they were able to garner support, the Manchus, who aided them,
        only agreed to work with them if they could hold the power at the end, still
        leading to the fall of the Dynasty.



    The Ming Dynasty fell due to a peasant rebellion, started by a man named Li
    Zicheng who formed a coup, so to speak and took over the government by force.
    This made the old government extremely unhappy and they needed a way to usurp
    him, so they asked one of their mortal enemies for help, the Manchus. The
    Manchus, however, wanted the power when Li Zicheng went down, and the old Ming
    agreed, dooming themselves.

The Cuban Revolution

    Are the people free to follow their ideals?


    Does the government have totalitarian-esque control over the people?

        Not really. Not only were the people free to do things, the emperor also did not control absolute power.

    Is the government responding to the needs of a sufficient portion of the people?

        Not at all. Pre-revolution president Batista ended up acting as more of a
        dictator than an actual president, and showed complete indifference to the
        cries of the people.

    Is the economy failing or on a very apparent downturn? Are there high taxes or unfair labor laws?

        It was a mess. Batista was tied to organized crime and allowed American
        companies to dominate Cuba's economy, along with the presence of high
        unemployment rates and limited water infrastructure on a sea-locked country.

    Can either party [either the rebels or the government] procure outside support?

        Yes, Batista was able to get support from the US. When he was elected, he
        represented the Communist Party, but in his second term, rapidly turned
        anti-communist, allowing the US' support. However, it was not enough.

    Are there people actively opposing the power?

        Well, yes. There was Fidel Castro and his brother Raul, who together started
        "The Movement" that led to the overthrow of Batista.

The Haitian Revolution

    Are the people free to follow their ideals?
    
        Yes, as long as it didn't affect their work.

    Does the government have totalitarian-esque control over the people?
    
        Yes, this was a slave rebellion against the whites who owned them (for this this situation we will
        call the whites the government and the slaves the people)

    Is the government responding to the needs of a sufficient portion of the people?
    
        No, they were slaves, the whites did not care for their wellbeing.

    Is the economy failing or on a very apparent downturn? Are there high taxes or unfair labor 
    laws?

        Yes, they were slaves of course the labor laws were unfair.

    Can either party [either the rebels or the government] procure outside support?

        Yes, the rebels procured the outside support of the Spanish

    Are there people actively opposing the power?

        Yes, previous attempts had been made, but they failed 


    The Haitian revolution was a slave and Maroon (free people of color) rebellion. It was inspired by the French and
    American revolutions and after a brief delay was led by a man named Toussaint. The revolution was quick, in only a few
    weeks they had seized the capital, shortly after the French sent troops to try and quell the revolution but seeing an
    opportunity the English also sent troops to try and seize the colony and shortly after so did the Spanish who armed and
    helped the rebels. Fearing all-out war the French sent an order that declared freedom for all slaves who joined the
    republicâ€™s army. Not long after the French authorities on the island issued a general emancipation decree abolishing
    slavery.
