# Our Case Studies

# the proof is in ~the pudding~ academics\case_studies.md

To actually prove that this is correct, we realized we had to do several, small case studies. These are nothing exceptional, and merely serve as a collection of facts that we've manipulated to make people think this actually works. And the way to do that is to actually feed the factors of the revolution through the program and answer the questions. So that will be in here.

---

Here are the questions, as they are presented.

    Are the people free to follow their ideals?

    Does the government have totalitarian-esque control over the people?

    Is the government responding to the needs of a sufficient portion of the people?

    Is the economy failing or on a very apparent downturn? Are there high taxes or unfair labor laws?

    Can either party [either the rebels or the government] procure outside support?

    Are there people actively opposing the power?

---t

The format of these case studies will be rather minimal as mentioned before, and will mainly consist of our key questions being answered and those answers being explained, with possibly a few notes at the end depending.

French Revolution (1789 – 1799)

    Are the people free to follow their ideals?

        Technically no. At the time there were not many considerable problems with the lack of rights and power. However, the desire of having a better system to govern the country as well as the belief that the common people were entitled to that power and wealth, created a newfound demand for a new democratic system.

    Does the government have totalitarian-esque control over the people?

        While not totalitarian, the French monarchy, originally pertained to be divinely chosen by god, has lost its credibility and power over the commonwealth, as more of the lower class was better educated and were less compliant with the monarchy. Unable to adapt to the sudden change of favour with the people, the monarchy was overwhelmed by the social pressures it was given. Commoners that owned portions of land, having more power and money, wanted have political power as well as the full rights of a landowner.

    Is the government responding to the needs of a sufficient portion of the people?

        No. The French people had a problem with the population rise from the better living quality, there was not enough supplies to meet the new found demand. France became the most populous country in Europe. Crop failures during 1788, as well as many economic problems resulting a lot of tension and unrest within the people.

    Is the economy failing or on a very apparent downturn? Are there high taxes or unfair labor laws?

        Yes. The French having participated in the American Revolution, have driven the economy down to the ground. Having no money, the monarch taxed the higher class, the clergy and nobles of France. The upper class being traditionally exempt from taxes, the monarch used the new method of thinking from the Enlightenment, creating “enlightened despots” to justify their new taxing which outraged many.

                “Enlightened despotism, also called benevolent despotism, a form of government in the 18th century in which absolute monarchs pursued legal, social, and educational reforms inspired by the Enlightenment.”

    Can either party [either the rebels or the government] procure outside support?

        There was no outside meddling for the French Revolution.

    Are there people actively opposing the power?

        Yes. As the insatisfaction of the people and their desire for more political power and replacing the monarchy, spurred on the French Revolution.

The Fall of the Ming Dynasty (1644)

    Are the people free to follow their ideals?

        Yes. For the most part, people were allowed to believe what they wanted to.

    Does the government have totalitarian-esque control over the people?

        Not really. People were free to do as they choose and the emperor did not hold absplute power.

    Is the government responding to the needs of a sufficient portion of the people?

        No, not at all. There was actually a massive famine leading up to the fall.

    Is the economy failing or on a very apparent downturn? Are there high taxes
    or unfair labor laws?

        Yes. This was actually a very key factor in the fall of the Dynasty.

    Are there people actively opposing the power?

        Yes. Li Zicheng's recently formed rebel government did not make everyone happy.

    Can either party [either the rebels or the government] procure outside support?

        The old government can and did, and this is where it gets tricky, because
        even though they were able to garner support, the Manchus, who aided them,
        only agreed to work with them if they could hold the power at the end, still
        leading to the fall of the Dynasty.

    The Ming Dynasty fell due to a peasant rebellion, started by a man named Li
    Zicheng who formed a coup, so to speak and took over the government by force.
    This made the old government extremely unhappy and they needed a way to usurp
    him, so they asked one of their mortal enemies for help, the Manchus. The
    Manchus, however, wanted the power when Li Zicheng went down, and the old Ming
    agreed, dooming themselves.

The Cuban Revolution

    Are the people free to follow their ideals?

        Yeah, everyone was pretty free to believe what they wanted.

    Does the government have totalitarian-esque control over the people?

        Not at all. People had a little too much freedom, and crime was very common.

    Is the government responding to the needs of a sufficient portion of the people?

        Not at all. Pre-revolution president Batista ended up acting as more of a
        dictator than an actual president, and showed complete indifference to the
        cries of the people.

    Is the economy failing or on a very apparent downturn? Are there high taxes or unfair labor laws?

        It was a mess. Batista was tied to organized crime and allowed American
        companies to dominate Cuba's economy, along with the presence of high
        unemployment rates and limited water infrastructure on a sea-locked country.

    Can either party [either the rebels or the government] procure outside support?

        Yes, Batista was able to get support from the US. When he was elected, he
        represented the Communist Party, but in his second term, rapidly turned
        anti-communist, allowing the US' support. However, it was not enough.

    Are there people actively opposing the power?

        Well, yes. There was Fidel Castro and his brother Raul, who together started
        "The Movement" that led to the overthrow of Batista.

    The Cuban Revolution happened because of President Bautista's ruining of the Cuban
    economy through letting American politics dominate it and his complete indifference
    to the needs of the people, making him not so much a leader but a waste of political
    space, and the Cuban people seemed to realize this. The Revolution was organized by
    a man named Fidel Castro and his brother Raul, the former of which sat in power
    until his recent death.

*The English Revolution*

    Are the people free to follow their ideals?

        No, King Charles I (the ruling monarch) is imposing a new Prayer Book on Scotland (which he also rules) and he punished those who refused to accept it.

    Does the government have totalitarian-esque control over the people?

        No, since people were mostly free to do what they pleased as long as it was not against the law.

    Is the government responding to the needs of a sufficient portion of the people?

        Not Sure

    Is the economy failing or on a very apparent downturn? Are there high taxes or unfair labor laws?

        Yes, the king is imposing high taxes (Called Forced Loan) to fund his wars with Spain and France.

    Can either party [either the rebels or the government] procure outside support?

        Yes, (for this sake we will call Parliament the rebels and the king the government) the rebels procure the support of Scotland.

    Are there people actively opposing the power?

        Yes, parliament opposed the Crown which was the power at that time.

*The Haitian Revolution*

    Are the people free to follow their ideals?

        Kind of, I guess. They were slaves, and freedom and slavery don't necessarily go to well together. But, for the most part, they were allowed to believe in whatever they wanted, as long as it dindn't get in the way of working.

    Does the government have totalitarian-esque control over the people?

        Yes, this was a slave rebellion against the whites who owned them (for this this situation we will call the whites the government and the slaves the people)

    Is the government responding to the needs of a sufficient portion of the people?

        No, they were slaves, the whites did not care for their wellbeing.

    Is the economy failing or on a very apparent downturn? Are there high taxes or unfair labor laws?

        Yes, they were slaves of coarse the labor laws were unfair.

    Can either party [either the rebels or the government] procure outside support?

        Yes, the rebels procured the outside support of the Spanish.

    Are there people actively opposing the power?

        Well, yeah. I'm pretty sure the slaves (whos land was invaded and the people forced into slavery) didn't necessarily enjoy being slaves that much.

    The Haitian revolution was a slave and Maroon (free people of color) rebellion. It was inspired by the French and American revolutions and after a brief delay was led by a man named Toussaint. The revolution was quick, for in only a few weeks the slaves had seized the capital, shortly after the French sent troops to try and quell the revolution. ut seeing an oppertunatie
