# revolutions-code: 
# All revolutions (political) have a set of conditions that must be met for them to occur.

A collaborative python-based project made to help analyze the political stability of a given state based off a number of Y/N questions.
This serves as a foray into programming as well as a study on the phenomenon of revolutions. 

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated, with the content or the code itself.
