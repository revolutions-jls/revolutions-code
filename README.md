# revolutions-code:
# All revolutions (political) have a set of conditions that must be met for them to occur.

Hi.

We're a few teenagers from Vancouver with a mild interest in politics and programming, and we decided to combine those two things over three terms of hard work and stress to bring you something that ~~may or may not work~~[errata: we know it *works*, but we're not entirely sure of its accuracy].
What we've made is a python3 program that asks you questions. In order to not confuse the program and get an accurate prediction, it is recommended to answer truthfully. And what does this program do with the hopefully truthful answers?

It returns a short sentence on the state of the country according to the answers of the questions. More specifically, how close or far you are to a revolution. However, most of the answers lean towards revolution, it's generally better to be safe than sorry. Also, it was made by a few teenagers, so take everything it says with a grain of salt.

For anyone who wants an answer to the looming question, *"Do you actually have academic proof that this works?"* the answer is yes. It's located in a long Markdown file just like this one inside the academics folder. It's called case_studies.md, and the name essentially explains it. It's a large blob of concise case studies for the validation of our endeavours and your reading displeasure.

Enjoy.

*If you want to run our code, ~~which you should,~~ and 1) do not have the python language installed, ii) do not know how or do not want to install python, ~~or c) feel uncomfortable about all the keyloggers we've included~~ then we have it hosted in one bloated mass of text on this fantastic site called trinket.io, which lets you host code for free online that can be run inside any browser (even mobile!) then you should click [here.](https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/8c0a784181 "revolutions-code on Trinket")*

# Thank you.
